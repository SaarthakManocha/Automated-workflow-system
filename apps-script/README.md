## Setup Instructions

1. In your Apps Script project, go to:
   `Extensions > Apps Script > Project Settings > Script Properties`

2. Set a new Script Property:
   - Key: `SERVICE_ACCOUNT_JSON`
   - Value: Paste your full Firebase service account JSON (as a single-line string)

You only need to do this once after cloning the repo.
